*An Against the Storm Tweakpack*

A variety pack of convenience features popularly requested for [Against the Storm](https://www.gog.com/game/against_the_storm). No real theme or direction, just things I found useful and easy to mod mashed together to hopefully be useful to others.

**This mod is currently InDev**. The code is a mess, there might be bugs, and the keybinds haven't been integrated into the options menu and as a result they aren't configurable. It is functional, but I'm hoping to go back and clean the mod up soon.

## Features

- Mines have a working area. No more missing out on a single ore spawn because a 3x3 area can't cover every deposit.
- You can immediately unassign all woodcutters using **Shift+X**. You can also use **Alt+X** to automatically unassign just enough woodcutters to exactly one Hostility level lower.
- Trader menu now also shows your City Score (an internal counter that determines which traders can spawn).
- In the trade menu, you can **Middle Click** to put up the minimal amount of items to match the current offer.
- **Ctrl+Click** on items in the ingredient wheel will bring you to the recipe panel, similar to left-clicking on other goods icons.
- Overview zoom Mode. Press **Backspace** in game to immediately gain a better perspective on your map. Press **Backspace** again to zoom back in.
- Hovering over a resource deposit and pressing the *Copy Building* key (default **Shift**) will request the construction of the associated gathering camp.
-  **5x** speed mode. Available as additional UI button and the **5** keybind. Gotta go fast!
- Access Consumption control using the new hotkey **I**
- Easily place Paths by pressing **P**
- **Ctrl+Right Click** workers in a building to schedule them to leave their position as soon as their next production cycle finishes
- You can now set a limit on the amount of villagers allowed in an individual house

## Installation

1. Download BepInEx 5: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.21/BepInEx_x86_5.4.21.0.zip
2. Extract into your Against the Storm game directory
3. Grab the latest release of this mod from https://github.com/ats-mods/Stormwalker/releases/latest/
4. Extract into the same Against the Storm game directory.
5. Run the game

Note that I bundle a BepInEx config with my release, which changes the loader's entry point. That's all it does. If you know what you're doing you can make the required changes yourself and just use the .dll
